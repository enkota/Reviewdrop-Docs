# Update Profile

## Updating Profile Username

We only recommend changing your username if you really have to. The reason being any links to reviews you have added over social media/email newsletters etc will 404 \(error\) as the profile URL changes.

To update the username please head to settings -&gt; [profile](https://reviewdrop.io/settings#/profile)

{% hint style="info" %}
Changing your username will result in 404 \(Broken\) links from your previous username url. Use at your own risk!
{% endhint %}
