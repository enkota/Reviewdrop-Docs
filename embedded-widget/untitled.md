# Add Reviews to Widget

Reviewdrop makes use of 2 review flows - _Externally Submitted_ and _Customer Submitted_. Externally submitted reviews are entered by you \(the owner\) manually and has ability to link to 3rd party sources such as Google or Facebook. Customer Submitted reviews make use of the Pro plan feature "Customer Submissions" to gather reviews via a public form that can be shared on your website or newsletters.

### Externally Submitted

To manually add an externally submitted review, navigate to the ["Widget Reviews"](https://reviewdrop.io/dashboard) page and click **"Create Review"** 

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Review Title** | Used as an internal reference for you and your staff. |
| **Type** | Text/Image/Video/External/Facebook/Google. |
| **Name** | Add the name of the reviewer or business. |
| **Category** | What kind of business sector do they fall under - if any. |
| **Rating** | Star rating. 5 possible stars. |
| **Website URL** | A link to the business or shops website. |
| **Review Message** | The reviewers message. Must be over 30 characters. |

### Customer Submitted

Customers are able to submit reviews which appear automatically on your profile page. Reviews submitted through this method still need to be manually approved to appear on the widget. The way we look at this is most busineses will only want to highlight positive reviews on their website and all reviews on your profile page.

{% hint style="info" %}
Customer Submitted is a **Pro** plan feature.
{% endhint %}

As an example, you can try our [submission page](https://reviewdrop.io/review/reviewdrop/submit). This can be found via your own profile page and then clicking the **"Write a Review"** button.

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Rating** | Star rating. 5 possible stars. |
| **Title** | The reviewers name or business. |
| **Type** | Text/Image/Video |
|  **Name** | Add the name of the reviewer or business. |
| **Category** | What kind of business sector do they fall under - if any. |
| **Website URL** | A link to the business or shops website. |
