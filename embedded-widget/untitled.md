# Add Reviews to Widget

Reviewdrop makes use of 2 review flows - Externally Submitted and Customer Submitted. Externally submitted reviews are entered by you \(the owner\) manually and has ability to link to 3rd party sources such as Google or Facebook. Customer Submitted reviews make use of the Pro plan feature "Customer Submissions" to gather reviews via a public form that can be shared on your website or newsletters.

### Externally Submitted
