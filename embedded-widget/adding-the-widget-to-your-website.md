## Standard

The Reviewdrop widget has been designed to work virtually anywhere. Just paste in the script code just before the **&lt;/head&gt;** closing tag on your site. Many website builders/cms tools have header script management built in. 

## WordPress

To install the widget with WordPress, please navigate to your theme **header.php** file.

1. Login to your WordPress admin dashboard.

4. At the end of your &lt;head&gt; tag, paste in the embed code found on the [Install Widget](https://reviewdrop.io/embed) page.

5. Hit **Update File** and you should be good to go!
