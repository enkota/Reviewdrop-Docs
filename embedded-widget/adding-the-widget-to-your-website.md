## Integrations

### Standard

The Reviewdrop widget has been designed to work virtually anywhere. Just paste in the script code just before the &lt;body&gt; closing tag on your site. Ideally, you can add this on your footer. Many website builders/cms tools have script management built in. 

### WordPress

### Squarespace

### BigCommerce

We are working on adding an app to the BigCommerce store. In the meantime you can navigate to:

{% hint style="info" %}
Bigcommerce Dashboard -&gt; Storefront -&gt; Footer Scripts
{% endhint %}

Paste in the embed code from the [builder](customise-widget-looks.md) and hit save.
