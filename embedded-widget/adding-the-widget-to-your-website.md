## Standard

The Reviewdrop widget has been designed to work virtually anywhere. Just paste in the script code just before the **&lt;/head&gt;** closing tag on your site. Many website builders/cms tools have header script management built in. 

## WordPress

To install the widget with WordPress, please navigate to your theme **header.php** file.

1. Login to your WordPress admin dashboard.

5. Hit **Update File** and you should be good to go!

## Squarespace

## BigCommerce

We are working on adding an app to the BigCommerce store. In the meantime you can navigate to:

{% hint style="info" %}
Bigcommerce Dashboard -&gt; Storefront -&gt; Footer Scripts
{% endhint %}

Paste in the embed code from the [builder](customise-widget-looks.md) and hit save.

## Shopify

To install the widget on Shopify we need to add the script to the footer. We will look at making this process easier through their app store in the future.

1. Navigate to your Shopify dashboard and click **Online Store -&gt; Themes**
2. Copy the embed code from Reviewdrop and head back to Shopify.
