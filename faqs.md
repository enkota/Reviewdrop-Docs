# FAQs

## How are reviews collected?

You have two options when collecting reviews. You can either automatically send reviews out on a conversion page such as an order completion page or send email invites out manually from the dashboard.

## Do you integrate with other platforms?

Yes! We already have support for WordPress/Woocommerce, Shopify, BigCommerce, Squarespace, Wix and Zapier. Integration for automated reviews is also available via our API. Get in touch if you would like to find out more.

We also have a dedicated [WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/reviewdrop/) to make installation even easier for Woocommerce powered shops.

You can also add our embedded widget on any platform that accepts javascript embed code.

## Are my first 5 reviews really free?

Yep, you also recieve 50 email invitations free so you can truly try our service on your system. Once you reach 50 email invites and recieve 5 reviews you have the option to keep as is or upgrade to our paid plans.

## Can reviews be moderated?

In short, yes. All reviews that are added to your company profile page \([example](http://reviewdrop.io/review/reviewdrop)\) will display regardless of rating. Reviews that appear on your website widget however can be moderated and keep you in control of visible reviews. Any review you think is fake please use the "Report" function found under each review page.

## How do you compare with X and Y?

We are striving to offer similar features to the larger review companies at a more affordable price. You can check out our Trustpilot comparison here - [https://reviewdrop.io/compare](https://reviewdrop.io/compare)
