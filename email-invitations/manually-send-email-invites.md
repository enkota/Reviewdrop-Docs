# Manually send email invites

There are two methods of sending email review invites to your customers. If you have an online store on Woocommerce, Bigcommerce or Shopify, then you can use the automatic conversion script to send email at a specific date after their order.

Alternatively, you can also send manual email invites to clients if you run a service type business.
