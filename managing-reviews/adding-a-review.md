# Add Review

### Customer Submitted

Customers are able to submit reviews which appear automatically on your profile page. Reviews submitted through this method need to be manually approved to appear on the widget. The way we look at this is most busineses will only want to highlight positive reviews on their website and keep all reviews on your profile page.

{% hint style="info" %}
Review submissions are a feature across **all plans**.
{% endhint %}

As an example, you can try our [submission page](https://reviewdrop.io/review/reviewdrop/submit). This can be found via your own profile page and then clicking the **"Write a Review"** button.
