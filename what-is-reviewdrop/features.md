## What sets us apart from competitors?

Our goal with Reviewdrop is to provide a fair balance to both the owner of the business and their customers. With the widget, you can view your best reviews - much like you see on most testimonial blocks on a website. Reviewdrop takes the hassle of having to always update new reviews on your site. 

Whenever a visitor sees a review, we provide feedback if this review was manually entered by the owner or submitted by a real customer. With the ability to add a link to an External/Google/Facebook review, this will really help customers on the Standard plan and smaller businesses their reviews are legit.

Our smart flagging system also blocks visitors who try and post multiple reviews from the public submission page. Don't worry, if a customer decides to come back in a month, they can write another review. Simple!

With the core features of Reviewdrop already in place, we think this is the perfect solution to cater small/medium business owners who can't afford the cost of enterprise review services and customer validation.

## How do you combat fake reviews?

Wherever a review appears on our system, we ensure the visitor is informed if the review is either:

1. **Externally submitted review:** Any review that is entered via the _**Widget Review**_ area.
2. **Customer submitted review:** Any review that is entered publically via the owners _**Profile**_.

Public submitted reviews are also checked if that particular visitor has submitted in the last 30 days. We set a limit of only 30 days incase they decide to write another review in the future. This should drastically help reduce fake reviewers. If we detect multiple reviews over time, all their reviews will be flagged and reviewed internally.

We currently **do not** capture customer emails as they serve no purpose for validation on our system.

### Response system

In addition to our External/Customer tagging feature, we allow owners to add their own response to reviews. Since public reviews **cannot** be deleted/edited, the owner should have their own say as to what the customer has written. 

If you have one bad review out of many, an owner response on the bad will always reflect well to new visitors as a one off.
